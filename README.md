# CoreLog

CoreLog is a simple backend API built with Node.js and Express that allows you to create, view, and delete log entries.  
It uses a JSON file for persistence, so data survives server restarts.

This project was built as a learning exercise to understand backend fundamentals such as APIs, routing, persistence, and project structure.
